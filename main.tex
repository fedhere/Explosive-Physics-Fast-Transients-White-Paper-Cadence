\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a cadence for the LSST survey that would enable the prompt discovery of rapidlly varying transients including rare and poorly characterised fast supernova-like objects, Kilonovae, and fast evolving features in slower evolving transients (e.g. signature of interaction in supernovae).  Their prompt detection and characterization requires 3 observations within a night in two filters to measure color and lightcurve evolution. These transients are intrinsically rare, thus LSST could dramatically improve our understanding of their origin and properties. This cadence can be implemented as a Minisurvey or as part of a WideFastDeep survey on selected portions of the sky.
\end{abstract}

\section{White Paper Information}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item {\bf Science Category:} Exploring the Transient Sky, Dark Energy
\item {\bf Survey Type Category:} 
We are proposing this cadence as a variation of the  `wide-fast-deep' (WFD) Main Survey, but it could also be considered for implementation as a Mini-Survey or a Deep Drilling Field, observing only a portion of the sky.) 
\item {\bf Observing Strategy Category:} 
   a specific observing strategy to enable specific time domain science, that is relatively agnostic to where the telescope is pointed.

\section{Scientific Motivation}
%\begin{footnotesize}
%{\it Describe the scientific justification for this white paper in the context of your field, as well as the importance to the general program of astronomy, including the relevance over the next decade. Describe other relevant data, and justify why LSST is the best facility for these observations. (Limit: 2 pages + 1 page for figures.)}

% This has an especially high impact in two cases: (1) the relatively short-duration late stages of stellar evolution where the star undergoes rapid changes in the lead up to a supernova, and (2) binary (or even tertiary) systems where dynamical evolution and/or mass transfer plays a key role in determining the stellar evolutionary processes and outcomes. 

Explosive and eruptive transients that rise and fall in brightness within $3$--$5$ days have historically been rarely discovered due to sky survey efficiencies, but are also intrinsically rare ($\sim 5\%$ of the rate of core-collapse supernovae; \citealt{2014ApJ...794...23D}). Similarly, {\it fast features} in otherwise slow evolving transient events, such as ejecta impacting circumstellar material or a binary companion star in stellar explosions, are rarely caught due to their short-lived nature, and also appear to be intrinsically rare. Fast transients and fast features in transients provide a unique window on the physical mechanisms and progenitor scenarios of stellar eruptions and explosions, and the late stages of stellar evolution including mass-loss and mass-transfer in binary systems.

The volume surveyed by LSST brings the promise of finding and characterizing many more intrinsically rare events, however, adequate time- and filter-sampling of relatively short-lived events is necessary to deliver on this promise. The requisit observations in order to find \emph{and recognize} these fast events early enough to trigger follow-up, {\it and/or} characterize a large sample of fast events with LSST photometry alone, are: (1) observations in two filters obtained in quick succession so that color can be measured, and (2) a same-filter revisit within hours so the light-curve behaviour can be analyzed. As we will show, the WFD baseline survey's inter-night revisit rate of once every three nights is too sparse, and the intra-night revisit rate of $\sim30$ minutes is too rapid, to identify (\emph{i.e.} detect and recognize) fast transients and fast features. The exact form of our proposed cadence is given in Section 3. To define our diagnostic we collect the early-time observer-frame color and rate of change of brightness for several exemplar types of fast transients and fast features in Table 1, discuss the main science goals for each type of transient below, and provide illustrative examples in Figure 1.

{\bf Fast Transients --} First discovered in PanSTARRs data by \cite{2014ApJ...794...23D}, also called rapidly fading supernovae (RFSNe), and thought to be driven by the shock of low-mass ejecta propagating through an extended stellar envelope or wind (e.g., \citealt{2018MNRAS.475.3152K}). There are only tens of such RFSNe discovered so far. The sample presented in \cite{2014ApJ...794...23D} mostly have $z<0.3$, rise to peak within $1$--$3$ days (e.g., PS1-10bjp rises by $2.2$ mag in $g$-band during the $2.7$ days before peak), and are optically blue (observer-frame; figure 9 of \citealt{2014ApJ...794...23D}).

{\bf Kilonovae --} The discovery of kilonovae, whether or not they are associated with LIGO events, yeilds new insights into neutron star mergers. The optical counterpart to GW170817 presented by \cite{2017ApJ...848L..27T} shows a $<2$-day rise to peak brightness, at which point the color $r-Y\sim0.5$, after which the emission evolves redward (e.g., their figure 3) and declines quickly (e.g., $6$ mag in $\sim10$ days; their figure 2, but see also \cite{2017Natur.551...75S}). Optical data fit with theoretical models leads to contraints on the ejecta mass and velocity and the radioactive power source.

{\bf Core Collapse Supernova Shock Breakout --} When the shock of the core collapse reaches the photosphere, high energy emission escapes in a short luminous burst (as theoretically predicted by, e.g., \citealt{1978ApJ...223L.109K}). The serendipidous discovery of nearby ($24.6$ Mpc) SN\,2016gkg's $\sim3$-day long shock-driven feature, which in it's first day exhibted a maximum rise rate of $\sim40$ $\rm mag\ day^{-1}$, is one of the best examples to date (\citealt{2018Natur.554..497B}; see also SN\,2011dh, \citealt{2011ApJ...742L..18A}). Observations of the shock breakout can directly constrain the star's radius and the mass in its envelope. While expected to be quite blue during the initial fast rise, the optical color can be neutral or even red during the $\lesssim 3$ day shock cooling phase, e.g., $B-V\sim0.5$ for SN\,2016gkg \citep[see their extended data table 3][]{2018Natur.554..497B}.

% to g-r~-0.1 via Lupton (2005) http://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/sdssUBVRITransform.php#Lupton2005
% which really isn't that appropriate

{\bf SNe\,Ia --} Blue bumps in the first hours/days of the SN\,Ia light curve are theoretically predicted to be the photometric signature of the SN\,Ia ejecta shocking a non-degenerate companion star \citep{2010ApJ...708.1025K}, and are best exemplified with observations of SN\,2017cbv by \cite{2017ApJ...845L..11H}. The values in Table \ref{tab:1} for normal and blue bump SNe\,Ia are for nearby ($<10$ Mpc) events, derived using the $UBVgri$ photometry for SN\,2017cbv and SN\,2011fe from \cite{2010ApJ...708.1025K} within the first day of observations (see their figures 1 and 2; $U-B$ is used as a substitute $g-r$, and there was no early-time $z$ or $y$ for these events). In this case, an new point source next to an elliptical galaxy rising at $>1$ $\rm mag\ day^{-1}$ with a $g-r < -0.5$ would be an excellent candidate for a blue-bump SN\,Ia and should receive immediate follow-up. %Furthermore, obtaining color and observations within the first $\sim5$ days after explosion would enable the creation of a sample able to set constraints on the fraction of SN\,Ia originating from Single Degenerate {\it vs} Double Degenerate progenitors (as done in \citealt{Bianco2011} and indicated in \citealt{COSEP} Section 6.3), with implications for stellar physics and cosmology (as SN\,Ia may follow different standardization rules for different progenitors, inducing systematics in cosmological inference).
Furthermore, such LSST early-time photometry and color data for SNe\,Ia could be stacked over all events, and enable statistical constraints on the fraction of SNe\,Ia that exhibit blue bumps (i.e., have non-degenerate companion stars), as done by \citealt{Bianco2011} and as indicated in Section 6.3 of \citealt{COSEP}. The types of companion stars of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that explode as SNe\,Ia has implications for stellar physics and cosmology.

\section{Technical Description}
%\begin{footnotesize}
%{\it Describe your survey strategy modifications or proposed observations. Please comment on each observing constraint below, including the technical motivation behind any constraints. Where relevant, indicate if the constraint applies to all requested observations or a specific subset. Please note which constraints are not relevant or important for your science goals.}
%\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{High-level description}
%\begin{footnotesize}
%{\it Describe or illustrate your ideal sequence of observations.}
%\end{footnotesize}

The prompt characterizaion of these transients, which enables the triggering of crucial follow up observations, requires determination of \emph{both color and lightcurve shape}. This in turns requires observations in 2 different filters within a short interval of time \dtone  and to return to the same field with one of those filter at a later time \dttwo.  The constraints on these timeline are :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item max(\dtone )
    \item min(\dttwo )
    \item filter pair $f_1-f_2$.
\end{enumerate}
This can be implemented simply by alternating pairs of visits on a field, and single visits on \emph{the previous field}. The single visits can alternate between the 2 filters reducint the number of filter changes.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/highLevelCadence.png}
\caption{Cadence example: two alternating filters cover regions of sky to obtain 3 observations per region, in 2 filters, with apprioriate time gaps to measure lightcurve color and shape.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Footprint -- pointings, regions and/or constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Describe the specific pointings or general region (RA/Dec, Galactic longitude/latitude or Ecliptic longitude/latitude) for the observations. Please describe any additional requirements, especially if there are no specific constraints on the pointings (e.g. stellar density, galactic dust extinction).}
\end{footnotesize}

This proposed cadence does not make any additional constraints on the imaging area compared to WFD. The science goals might be reachable if the proposed cadence was implemented over a sub-region of the WFD survey area.  

\subsection{Image quality}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the image quality (seeing).}\end{footnotesize}

This proposed cadence does not make any additional constraints on the image quality compared to WFD. 

\subsection{Individual image depth and/or sky brightness}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the sky brightness in each image and/or individual image depth for point sources. Please differentiate between motivation for a desired sky brightness or individual image depth (as calculated for point sources). Please provide sky brightness or image depth constraints per filter.}
\end{footnotesize}

Should be the same as WFD standars

\subsection{Co-added image depth and/or total number of visits}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it  Constraints on the total co-added depth and/or total number of visits. Please differentiate between motivations for a given co-added depth and total number of visits. Please provide desired co-added depth and/or total number of visits per filter, if relevant.}
\end{footnotesize}

Should be the same as WFD standards.

\subsection{Number of visits within a night}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the number of exposures (or visits) in a night, especially if considering sequences of visits.  }
\end{footnotesize}

The proposed candence requires at least 3 visits per night.

\subsection{Distribution of visits over time}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the timing of visits --- within a night, between nights, between seasons or between years (which could be relevant for rolling cadence choices in the WideFastDeep. Please describe optimum visit timing as well as acceptable limits on visit timing, and options in case of missed visits (due to weather, etc.). If this timing should include particular sequences of filters, please describe.}
\end{footnotesize}

Three  observations in 2 filters, 2 in different filters separated by $\lesssim45$ minutes, returning to the field with either one of the filters in $\gtrsim90$ minutes.

%%%and the next visit - do we need to come back in the same filter? 


\subsection{Filter choice}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Please describe any filter constraints not included above.}
\end{footnotesize}

Filters should be pair with a gap in the sequence: g-i or r-z.                                                       
\subsection{Exposure constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Describe any constraints on the minimum or maximum exposure time per visit required (or alternatively, saturation limits). Please comment on any constraints on the number of exposures in a visit.}
\end{footnotesize}

This proposed cadence uses the baseline exposure times of $2\times15$ seconds or $1\times30$ seconds.

\subsection{Other constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Any other constraints.}
\end{footnotesize}
This cadence should be implemented on extragalactic fields and some GP fields to detect and characterize microlensing events on short timescales; binary stars and BH.


\subsection{Estimated time requirement}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Approximate total time requested for these observations, using the guidelines available at \url{https://github.com/lsst-pst/survey_strategy_wp}.}
\end{footnotesize}

Since our proposed cadence is a modification of the WFD strategy -- a shuffling of the visits, not adding visits -- it does not request any additional time.

For example, individual image depth depends on image quality, sky brightness, and number of exposures in a visit; if your science depends on the individual image depth but not directly on the other parameters, individual image depth would be `1' and the other parameters could be marked as `3', giving us the most flexibility when determining the composition of a visit, for example.}

\subsection{Technical trades}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it To aid in attempts to combine this proposed survey modification with others, please address the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off between your requested survey footprint (area) and requested co-added depth or number of visits?
    \item If not requesting a specific timing of visits, what is the effect of a trade-off between the uniformity of observations and the frequency of observations in time? e.g. a `rolling cadence' increases the frequency of visits during a short time period at the cost of fewer visits the rest of the time, making the overall sampling less uniform.
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off on the exposure time and number of visits (e.g. increasing the individual image depth but decreasing the overall number of visits)?
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off between uniformity in number of visits and co-added depth? Is there any benefit to real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant single-visit limiting depth?
    \item Are there any other potential trade-offs to consider when attempting to balance this proposal with others which may have similar but slightly different requests?
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Performance Evaluation}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Please describe how to evaluate the performance of a given survey in achieving your desired science goals, ideally as a heuristic tied directly to the observing strategy (e.g. number of visits obtained within a window of time with a specified set of filters) with a clear link to the resulting effect on science. More complex metrics which more directly evaluate science output (e.g. number of eclipsing binaries successfully identified as a result of a given survey) are also encouraged, preferably as a secondary metric. If possible, provide threshold values for these metrics at which point your proposed science would be unsuccessful and where it reaches an ideal goal, or explain why this is not possible to quantify. While not necessary, if you have already transformed this into a MAF metric, please add a link to the code (or a PR to \href{https://github.com/lsst-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib}{sims\_maf\_contrib}) in addition to the text description. (Limit: 2 pages).}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Diagnostic Metric}

Based on our evaluation of the light curves of fast transients, and the fast features of longer duration transients, we create a {\it diagnostic} metric that checks for the frequency with which the LSST observing simulation executes our desired filter-revisit cadence. 

\subsection{The Other Kind of Metric}

The metric is the fraction of events for which the color and risetime is constrained (within some accuracy). Different science cases may have different input lightcurves and different gap constraints


\subsection{Create OpSim}

{\tt OpSim} runs are being created that perform $f_1$ observations on a field, 30 min later repeat the pointing pattern in $f_2$, and 60 min later repeat the pointing pattern in $f_1$ or $f_2$, where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are $g$ and $i$, or $r$ and $z$. Non-adjacent filters are used to get a better leverage on the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) color.
