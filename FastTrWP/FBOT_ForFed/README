This folder contains several things:

Overall thing to be aware of: many of literature examples of fast transients do not have well constrained rise times.

**Folder: PS1**
This constains various information for all the PanSTARRS events. In particular, I have included:
(1) Raw photometry. This includes a machine readable table with photmetry and pre-post explosion upper limits for all of the events.
(2) Intepolated Photom Props. Probably less relevant here, but these are files with bolometric light curves and temperature/radius evolution for most of the events.
(3) Templates: These are interpolated griz light curves and temperature evolution that I spend some care creating, in particlar things that I thought faithfully represented their pre-peak evolution. These are the templates that I used to actually run the big Monte Carlo simulation where I injected millions of events into the PS1 cadence to pull out the rates.

Here are the redshifts for these best events:

PS1-10ah 0.074
PS1-10bjp 0.113
PS1-11qr 0.324
PS1-12bb 0.101
PS1-12bv 0.405
PS1-23brf 0.275

**Folder: Other Fast Transients**
The first two are json files that have been downloaded from Open SN Catalog.
I apologize that the last one is actually tex files right now. I'm working on getting another copy.
Redshifts given here.
NB: there are a others that I am trying to get my hands on the actually light curves for. 
PTF09uj 0.0657
iPTF16asu 0.187
AT2018cow 0.0141

**Folder: CoolingEnvelope**
<All Of these are COMING>
Type IIb: A sample of early Type IIb light curves with shock cooling. 
SN1987A: has an early peak.
SN2013ge: A Type Ic SN with a fast early rise.
