 are the original figures (from those papers as per name) which originated the cartoon figures in Fig 1 of our paper. The final version of our figure panels are in [figures](https://github.com/fedhere/prestocolor/tree/master/paper/figures)
Those are ultimately combined in Paper figure 1 and are generated through a design interface. 

[highLevelCadence.png](highLevelCadence.png) is the original version of Paper figure 2 and is a high level, schematic representation of the cadence implementation for LSST, and it is generated through a design interface (as it was in the White Paper submission). The final version is in [cadence_highlevel.png](https://github.com/fedhere/prestocolor/blob/master/paper/figures/cadence_highlevel.png)

LSST_PhaseSpace2_g_0.0_4.0.html	can be viewed rendered outside of github (click on the link), it is a dynamic version of Figure 3. Similarly, this folder contains similar plots for different filters and time gaps.
